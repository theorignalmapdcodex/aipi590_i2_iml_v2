# Telco Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

This project analyzes customer churn in a telecommunications company using interpretable machine learning models. The goal is to understand factors contributing to customer churn and predict which customers are at risk of leaving the company.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter notebook in this repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Telco Customer Churn dataset, including:

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model development and evaluation
- Interpretability analysis

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains information about:

- Customer demographics (gender, age, partner status)
- Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)
- Services used (phone, internet, additional features)
- Churn status

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/telco-customer-churn.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd telco-customer-churn
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the `aipi590_i2_iml_v2.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

6. Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Key Findings

The notebook explores various aspects of customer churn, including:

- Identification of key features influencing churn
- Development of interpretable machine learning models
- Evaluation of model performance and interpretability
